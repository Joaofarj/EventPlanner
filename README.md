  - Exception handling for potential input/output errors.


## Tests

The tests conducted on the code were performed using the 'events.dat' file available in the 'Trabalho' folder. This file contains sample event data used to validate the functionality of the application. During the testing process, various operations such as adding, editing, and deleting events were executed to ensure the application's reliability and correctness. The results indicated that all features operated as expected, and no issues or errors were encountered. This successful testing demonstrates the robustness and stability of the code.


## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

- **NetBeans:** `Build > Build Main Project`

### 6. Run the Project

After successfully building the project, you can run it:
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** `Run > Run 'MainWindow'`
- **Eclipse:** Right-click on the `MainWindow` class and select `Run As > Java Application`.
- **NetBeans:** Right-click on the project and select `Run`.

### 7. Verify Application Functionality

Upon running the project, a main window should appear, allowing you to add, edit, and manage events.
Conduct various operations to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.

### 8. Testing the Application

- The tests for the application were conducted using the `events.dat` file.
- Place the `events.dat` file in the appropriate directory required by the code.
